		<p>Currently the default word set is entirely french and variable length words, and I haven't implemented a way to change it yet... I'll get to it later...</p>

		<p>To play another game, just reload the page! (Another thing I need to actually provide a button for... (It's exam season so you can't blame me for being busy...))</p>

		<p><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Warning:</span> The Word Set is being pulled from a third-party which I have not fully vetted because it's a few thousand words long (e.g. there could be inappropriate words)</p>
